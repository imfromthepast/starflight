# Starflight
Starflight was a space exploration game that came out in 1985. It was awesome then and it is awesome now.

This project is an attempt to recreate that game in an HTML 5 canvas app using nothing but a canvas tag, some javascript, and local storage.

Along with recreating the original game, I want to incorporate the sequel story and features as well as extending the game to a third story, and improve the UI while I am at it.
